#### Selenium Webdriver & Support
Selenium is a set of different software tools each with a different approach to supporting browser automation. These tools are highly flexible, allowing many options for locating and manipulating elements within a browser, and one of its key features is the support for automating multiple browser platforms. This package contains the .NET bindings for the newer, more concise and object-based Selenium WebDriver API, which uses native OS-level events to manipulate the browser, bypassing the JavaScript sandbox, and does not require the Selenium Server to automate the browser.

## Known Issues #

- Firefox has sometimes been inconsistent with testing results.  The click command is inconsistent. This is a known issue and has been reported to that team that manages that driver. 
- IE Driver has a 32-bit version and a 64-bit version. If you're using the 32-bit version on 64-bit windows with 64-bit IE then the driver will not work as intended.  Use the appropriate version of IE Driver with the specific version of IE.
